# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Project Reset - Fresh Start
The Anthropic Mastery project is beginning from a **complete reset** with a new product vision focused on AI conversation analysis and learning. While we're starting fresh conceptually, we have a solid technical foundation to build upon.

### New Product Direction
**LATEST UPDATE (January 10, 2025)**: Complete Memory Bank Reset for Anthropic Mastery
